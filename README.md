ferris wheel rides, ski lifts! The list goes on...

## Contributing

### Requirements

This package uses [Poetry][poetry] for dependency management. You **must have**
this tool installed to contribute.

### Getting Started

After cloning the repository, run `poetry install` to set up your machine. This
command creates a virtual environment and install both product and development
dependencies.

After you make your change, run `make` and make sure the tests pass. In
addition to running tests, this command formats files using [`black`][black] and
lints the repository using [`flake8`][flake8].

Finally, push your changes and [submit a pull request][pr]!

### General Development Practices

Use `poetry run <command>` to invoke commands using the managed virtual
environment, or use `poetry shell` to open a shell directly in the virtual
environment. See this repository's Makefile for examples. For further
information, please reference the [Poetry documentation][poetry-docs].
